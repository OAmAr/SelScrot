# SelScrot
Really simple script I made to copy sections of the screen to the clipboard. Couldn't find any scripts that did this in a way that could be run from dmenu so I wrote this as a wrapper and clean-up for scrot -s

# Setup
run install.sh as root. 

# Dependencies (install.sh will use apt-get to install them)
xclip
scrot

# Usage
scrots delay
delay defaults to 0

# Have Fun
